Building and running the Unity project from the command line requires an installation of the Unity Editor. For our project, we used version 2022.3.32f1.

Project Description:
Our game revolves around preparation, evacuation, and if possible we want to include recovery as well. These three stages will be comprised of multiple minigames that the player will complete to progress. The minigames themselves are designed to inform players about the proper actions to take during preparation, evacuation, and recovery from wildfires.
