Building and running the Unity project from the command line requires an installation of the Unity Editor. For our project, we used version 2022.3.32f1.

Project Description:
Our game revolves around preparation for and evacuation from a wildfire situation. These stages are comprised of several minigames which are designed to inform players about the proper actions to take during these stages of a fire-based disaster. The main goal of the game is to create an educational experience aimed at young students who may not be familiar with the proper procedures during a disaster.
