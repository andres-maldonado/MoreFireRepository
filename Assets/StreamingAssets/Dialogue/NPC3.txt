MC: Hey [NPC3], have you heard about the wildfire nearby? I wanted to make sure you’re aware and prepared!
NPC3: Yep, and I’ve got an essentials bag packed in case we need to evacuate too! I recommend that you put one together yourself.
MC: Oh, that’s actually what I’m doing right now! I’m going to the store to grab what I need.
NPC3: Good on you! I'll go ahead and leave you to it.
NPC3: Oh, before you go, I actually had a spare first aid kit lying around. You can have it if you want!
MC: Really? That'd be great, thanks!
NPC3: Sure thing! Good luck getting the rest of what you need!
