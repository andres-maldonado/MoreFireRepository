MC: Hey [NPC3], have you heard about the wildfire nearby? I wanted to make sure you’re aware and prepared!
NPC3: Yep, and I’ve got an essentials bag packed in case we need to evacuate too! I recommend that you put one together yourself.
MC: Oh, that’s actually what I’m doing right now! I’m going to the store to grab what I need.
NPC3: Good on you! I’ll leave you to it! Stay safe!
